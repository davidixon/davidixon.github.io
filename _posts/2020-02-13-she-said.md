*She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement* by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey is a behind-the-scenes look at their reporting of [Harvey Weinstein's decades-long sexual assaults of women and pay-offs](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html).

Like many people, I was aware of the story and some of the actresses involved, but unlike the stories about Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh also chronicled here, didn't know many of the details and found this to be a thoroughly engaging read. Getting the women's stories, corroborating evidence such as the non-disclosure settlements, and getting the women to come forward with their names publicly all seems incredibly challenging and not something many journalists would handle as successfully or with as much care as Kantor and Twohey.
