01 [How Gillian Welch and David Rawlings Held Onto Optimism](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/03/magazine/gillian-welch-david-rawlings.html). Gillian Welch releasing so much new music is among the few good things that have happened this year.

02 [The Problem of Free Speech in an Age of Disinformation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/magazine/free-speech.html). Emily Bazelon on why the solution to bad speech being more speech is no longer practical.

03 [What Happens When Trump Gets Out Of Our Brains?](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katherinemiller/trump-leave-white-house-inside-our-heads). Katherine Miller on how life will improve once the president is again just another twitter troll one can simply mute and never have to think about.

04 [Trump Won’t Accept Defeat. Ever.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/trumps-forever-campaign-is-just-getting-started/617021/) Anne Applebaum on why the president is unable to accept the reality of his loss.

05 [COVID took my grandfather. But it wasn’t what killed him.](https://www.thecut.com/article/covid-deaths-injustice.html) Sarah Jones on the death of her grandfather and the injustice of the American healthcare system.

Two books I finished reading this week:

[*The Year of the Witching*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593099605/) by Alexis Henderson. This is described as a 'feminist horror' novel about a young woman in a puritanical society and while a more mystical or magical version of *The Handmaid's Tale* could be interesting, this isn't.

[*Debt: The First 5,000 Years*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Q1HZMCW/) by David Graeber. An interesting history of debt and how the concept has changed over time across different socialities and economic systems.
