I ran 2,222 miles in 2019, [according to my Strava profile](https://www.strava.com/athletes/8121781). That was 215 miles fewer than in 2018 and so it's the first year I haven't ran more miles than in the previous year since taking up running in 2014.

This was kind of disappointing to see, but I do think I've still improved as a runner overall. This lower mileage can mostly be explained by the fact that I spent the spring and summer living in El Paso, Texas. While I'm quite used to running in the heat, and being from Georgia actually found the lack of humidity pleasant, the extreme sunniness that comes a higher elevation made doing long runs a less enjoyable experience. As such, I spent many nights running on a school track at night and did more speedwork than I had ever previously done.

For 2020, I'm going to continue focusing on getting faster and try to set new personal bests in the 5K, 10K and half marathon. Maybe I might even run a full marathon.
