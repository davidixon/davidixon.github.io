Olivia Nuzzi, writing about the death of her mother and how the Bidens are suited for this moment in American history:

> Death is our great equalizer, but not all death is created equal, and American history provides no perfect comparison for the losses we’ve had lately. The Civil War claimed between 620,000 and 750,000 lives over four years. The influenza pandemic that began in 1918 claimed an estimated 675,000 Americans over two years. The coronavirus has killed half a million in a single year. And then there are the untold others, the people for whom the pandemic determined not the cause of death but its circumstances. My mother started treatment in January 2020. She never got to meet my brother’s son, her first grandchild, born in August. The hospital where she died didn’t allow visitors for patients who were not “expiring.” She wasn’t expiring until, on that Wednesday morning, she suddenly was. My father died in 2015, and she hadn’t remarried. When her heart stopped beating, my brother was in the room — via videoconference.

My father died from lung cancer last September and not being able to see him again before he passed was horrible. It is nice that there are now people in the White House that at least care about others.
