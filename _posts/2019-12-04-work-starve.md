Sarah Jones, for *New York Magazine*:

> It is not unusual for a Republican administration to seek cuts to welfare. It’s not even totally out of character for a Democratic president to do the same. (Triangulation, as practiced by Bill Clinton, had its victims.) But Trump has pursued this objective with remarkable vigor, and the USDA’s new food-stamp rule, out today, is proof.

The cruelty is, of course, [the point](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/).
