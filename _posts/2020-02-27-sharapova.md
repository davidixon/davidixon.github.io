Christopher Clarey, writing for the *New York Times*:

> To understand why Maria Sharapova is retiring from professional tennis at age 32, it helps to know what she can no longer endure.

> “I look at photos of myself and of the motion where I’m just about to hit the ball, and I’m in the air or just as I’m making contact,” she said on Tuesday, “and I can’t even look at it because it makes me cringe. I have so much pain.”

Maria Sharapova could have retired due to her injury issues at any point in the last ten years. That she continued playing and won the French Open in both 2012 and 2014 is a testament to how great a fighter she is. It's sad that for many people, what they're going to remember isn't that, but the twenty times she lost to Serena Williams---not the two huge wins in 2004---and, of course, the failed drug test in 2016.

But I'll remember how great she was and how her 2004 Wimbledon victory got me interested in tennis.
