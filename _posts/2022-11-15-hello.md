I'm going to give writing a 'blog' on my personal website another try, I think. Like most people, I find the continued destruction of Twitter by a complete narcissist disheartening and figure I need a new place to write things. Why not here?

Out of expediency, I'm using GitHub Pages because it's what I used the last time I tried this and it and Jekyll are things I'm still somewhat familiar with, but platform and design are very much subject to change. It's been a long time.
