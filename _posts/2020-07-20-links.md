[Do Not Call John Lewis a “Hero” if You Stood in His Way](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/07/john-lewis-mitch-mcconnell-brian-kemp-gop-voting-rights.html)

Joel Anderson, *Slate*:

> Lewis continued his march for equality long after he survived the beating in Selma. It is an obvious tragedy that so much of his life’s work remained undone, something he alluded to last summer. “Our struggle is not the struggle of a day, a week, a month, or a year—it is the struggle of a lifetime,” he posted on Twitter. But it’s important to remember, as the tributes roll in, that the struggle continues because of people like Brian Kemp and Mitch McConnell. They are not the well-meaning allies who happen to sit on the other side of the aisle. They are not the good men who had reasonable disagreements with a civil rights icon. If John Lewis is a hero, they are the villains.

[Insane after coronavirus?](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n14/patricia-lockwood/diary)

Patricia Lockwood, writing for the *London Review of Books*:

> ‘Florida and Ohio, man,’ the barista at the local café said to my husband, when he asked about the tourist trade. ‘People here at least acknowledge that it’s real. But people from Florida and Ohio don’t even seem to think it’s happening.’ Having lived in both places, I believe him: I have long had a theory that the surrealism that has overtaken the political landscape in America can be traced back to the poisoned ground of Ohio Facebook.

[Inside Trump’s Failure: The Rush to Abandon Leadership Role on the Virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-response-failure-leadership.html)

Michael D. Shear, Noah Weiland, Eric Lipton, Maggie Haberman and David E. Sanger, the *New York Times*:

> But their ultimate goal was to shift responsibility for leading the fight against the pandemic from the White House to the states. They referred to this as “state authority handoff,” and it was at the heart of what would become at once a catastrophic policy blunder and an attempt to escape blame for a crisis that had engulfed the country — perhaps one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in generations.

[The Conspiracy Singularity Has Arrived](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v7gz53/the-conspiracy-singularity-has-arrived)

Anna Merlan, *Vice News*:

> But it’s not just QAnon. The strain of living in this particular time, with a dragging, devastating pandemic and a global uprising against police brutality and racial injustice, crashing together at the highest speed, has accelerated something that’s been going on for years. Call it the conspiracy singularity: the place where many conspiracy communities are suddenly meeting and merging, a melting pot of unimaginable density. UFO conspiracy theorists and QAnon fans are advocating for drinking a bleach solution promoted by anti-vaxxers. QAnon groups and Reopen America groups alike promoted Plandemic , a film clip jam-packed with conspiratorial claims about the causes and spread of COVID. The Freedom Angels, an anti-vaccine group based in California, are among the many such groups joining anti-lockdown protests, using language that feels heavily drawn from the Patriot movement: They're calling stay-at-home orders “tyranny,” addressing their followers as “Patriots,” and positioning themselves as “a new civil rights movements.” (They urged people to burn their facemasks on July 4th, adding, floridly: “Join millions of Americans on Independence Day as we show all these BLUE STATE GOVERNORS, SWAMP DOCS, and DEEP STATE RATS 🐀 how we feel about their latest ORDERS, DICTATES and MANDATES to wear our muzzles again.”)
