Katie Heaney, writing in *The Cut*:

> Among the pastimes I’ve acquired over the past few years, the most long-lasting has been video games I play on my Nintendo Switch, and I think I’ve finally figured out why. No matter the game’s subject matter, style, or story, my favorites all have one central element that feels deeply familiar: a never-ending stream of busywork and chores.

> *Zelda: Breath of the Wild* is about running errands. *Skyrim* is about running errands. *The Witcher* is really about running errands. There are larger narratives and goals to each, and a fair amount of fighting, but between the battles and the pieces of origin story (which I personally don’t care about), there is a sweet, steady supply of tasks I must complete. Video games are a to-do list you play.

Running errands in well-designed games such as *The Outer Worlds* or *The Witcher 3* is a lot more fun than running errands in real life.
