Soraya Nadia McDonald, writing for ESPN's The Undefeated:

> Then last September, in Flushing Meadows, Osaka beat her idol, Serena Williams, in a U.S. Open final that will live in the annals of tennis history. Four months later, she claimed her second straight grand slam title at the Australian Open. A star, however reluctant she might have been to show her face, was born.
>
> Now Naomi Osaka is the world’s No. 1—and still very much a mystery.

Naomi Osaka is a frustrating person to watch play tennis&mdash;amazing at times, completely disinterested at other times&mdash;but so fascinating off-court.
