Wes Siler, writing for *Outside*:

> Bluetooth is a wireless transmission standard that a whole host of devices use to transmit data over short distances. It’s what your phone uses to pair with your car stereo and what your AirPods use to connect with your phone. These days all manner of devices use it, including tablets, laptops, cameras, speakers, and phones—basically, most things a thief may want to steal, except for your keys and cold hard cash. (Although if you use a Tile or similar locater dongle on your key chain or in your wallet, then those are discoverable using a Bluetooth scanner, too.) No pairing or security protocols are necessary; the scanners simply locate the signal a device emits and then evaluate its strength and frequency. Comparing that data against a database, they’re able to identify exact devices using a digital fingerprint. 

Car break-ins are a common occurrence at one of the trails I frequently run at. I would guess the vast majority of these are smash-and-grabs where someone has simply left their backpack or purse visible and my avoidance of doing such has coincided with my car never being broken into, but it wouldn't surprise me if I see police reports suggesting thieves using such apps in the future.

I'm sure it's something Apple and other major smartphone manufacturers can address with software updates that stop their devices from emitting signals publicly like this, but it seems unlikely that many manufacturers would bother with older phones, notebooks, or anything like headphones or portable speakers nor are Apple and Google very likely to remove such apps from their respective stores given the many valid legal uses for them.
