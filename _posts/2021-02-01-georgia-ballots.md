Andrew Appel:

> Voters in Georgia polling places, 2020, used Ballot-Marking Devices (BMDs), touchscreen computers that print out paper ballots; then voters fed those ballots into Precinct-Count Optical Scan (PCOS) voting machines for tabulation. There were many allegations about hacking of Georgia’s Presidential election. Based on the statewide audit, we can know that the PCOS machines were not cheating (in any way that changed the outcome). But can we know that the touchscreen BMDs were not cheating? And what about next time? There’s a nightmare scenario waiting to happen if Georgia (or other states) continue to use touchscreen BMDs on a large scale.


Having voted in-person for the primary, general election, and the January run-offs in Georgia this election cycle, I'm much happier with the new system and its printed paper record compared to the finicky ancient touchscreens I used in every past election while living in this state.

The ballot-marking devices were responsive and it didn't take me multiple attempts to select a candidate for a given race. The only annoyance was the general election featuring twenty candidates for one of the US Senate races and needing to scroll through all of those names to find the candidate you intended to vote for (this is more of an issue that the Democratic and Republican parties could address by just choosing single candidates to represent their parties... might have saved us from one of those run-offs and some of the constant barrage of ads and junk mail).

As Appel points out, though, the paper printout could be made much more readable than currently designed. It shouldn't take much more than a quick glance at each race to make sure your ballot recorded the correct candidate and shouldn't feel like you're looking at technical computer code.
