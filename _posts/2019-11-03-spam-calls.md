Sometimes the complaints have been typed into Twitter; more often they been spit out between clenched teeth as yet another damned thing doesn’t do what it should. But iOS 13 has added one new feature that is both incredibly valuable and works.

I had mostly been happy with using Verizon's [Call Filter service and app](https://www.verizonwireless.com/solutions-and-services/call-filter/) to deal with the plague that the FCC, FTC, and other relevant government agencies have failed to address, but in the past few weeks, an annoying amount of calls have gotten through and so I've enabled the nuclear option that Apple has provided here.

Apple's software quality as of late has been unquestionably bad, but this seems to be working and is probably simple enough that even they couldn't mess it up. It just silences and sends any call from a number not saved in your contacts to voicemail.
