Adam Serwer, writing for *The Atlantic*:

> Americans want to believe that the surge in white-supremacist violence and recruitment—the march in Charlottesville, Virginia, where neo-Nazis chanted “Jews will not replace us”; the hate crimes whose perpetrators invoke the president’s name as a battle cry—has no roots in U.S. soil, that it is racist zealotry with a foreign pedigree and marginal allure.

This was published days before a white nationalist terrorist [murdered forty-nine people in two New Zealand mosques](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/world/australia/new-zealand-mosque-shooting.html) and is quite something to read afterwards.
