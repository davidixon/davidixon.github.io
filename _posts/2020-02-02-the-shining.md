★★★★☆

*The Shining* is a novel I've read a number of times over the years and I mostly re-read it now so I can read the sequel, *Doctor Sleep*, soon. Yes, I know that sequel came out in 2013 and it's now 2020, but there are a lot of books to get through in this world.

It's a tense horror novel, but not especially scary. Jack Torrance's descent into madness is gradually and the backstory makes it easier to be empathetic to him compared to Jack Nicholson's portrayal in the film adaptation. The hotel is clearly the monster in this story and has so much detailed life compare to most haunted houses in other novels.
