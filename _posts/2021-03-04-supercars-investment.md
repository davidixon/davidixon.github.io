Kyle Stock, *Bloomberg*:

> If you were prescient enough to buy a seminal 300SL new for its $7,000 sticker price, lock it in a garage, and take good care of it, the machine would fetch roughly $1.4 million today, an annualized return of about 8%, not accounting for inflation, storage, and maintenance. Youâ€™d have been much better off in the Dow Jones index, which requires zero oil filters.

If something as *iconic* as the Mercedes 300SL has seen that little of an increase in value over *seventy years*, the chances of success for people spending $100,000+ on Dodge Hellcats with the hopes of selling them for a million or two dollars in twenty or thirty years don't seem very good.
