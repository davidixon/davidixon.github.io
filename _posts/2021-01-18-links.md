01 [The worst thing I read in 2020](https://kosoff.medium.com/book-review-the-worst-thing-i-read-in-2020-a3baa5cc13c6). Maya Kosoff is much better at writing about a bad book than I am. I prefer just not to write about such experiences.

02 [Who Taught Women That They Should Only Eat 1,200 Calories A Day?](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/scaachikoul/1200-calorie-diet-body-week) Scaachi Koul on the 1,200 calorie diet and why it persists despite its inadequacy for almost any adult woman.

03 [The American Abyss](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/magazine/trump-coup.html). Timothy Snyder on the events of January 6th and the last four years.

04 [The Coming Republican Amnesia](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/01/republicans-are-already-rewriting-trump-years/617715/). McKay Coppins on how the Republican party will try to forget the way they debased themselves in support of Donald Trump for the last four years. I have a feeling they'll suddenly start caring about the national debt again, too.

05 [The Fire Last Time](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/opinion/oklahoma-city-bombing-terror-death-penalty.html). Elizabeth Bruenig writes about the curtailing of rights for death row inmates after one of the last major domestic terrorist attacks, 1995's Oklahoma City bombing. There will almost certainly be legislative action following the January 6th attack on the US Capitol that over-reaches and does little to prevent such attacks.
