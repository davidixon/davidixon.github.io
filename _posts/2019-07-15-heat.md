An interesting look by the *Washington Post's* Rick Maese at how heat affects athletic performance and what is being done to cope with climate change:

> From community races to the Olympics to the World Cup, event organizers are already having to make adjustments to competition schedules and start times. And athletes around the world are having to take more precautions as science and technology evolve to help them cope with the heat — or, in some cases, gain a competitive advantage.
>
> Events such as the Australian Open have instituted safety measures to account for extreme heat. The International Olympic Committee and FIFA have formed committees to study heat-related issues at major events. Next summer’s Olympics in humid Tokyo will feature a marathon that starts at 6 a.m.
