In a past life, I used to be very into trying new monospace fonts, but have largely stuck with [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for the past couple years. Cascadia Code could eventually replace it, as I really like how it looks on-screen, but it's missing quite a few accented characters.
