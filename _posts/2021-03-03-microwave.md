Helen Rosner, writing for the *New Yorker*:

> I would like to say that this awakening kicked off a lifelong love affair with microwave cooking. In fact, I have spent my adult years using the device mostly to pop popcorn, zap leftovers, and thaw frozen bricks of ground beef, while my dog-eared copy of “The Microwave Gourmet” slumbers on the shelf. Despite all of Barbara Kafka’s sophisticated exhortations, I never quite reached escape velocity from the popular narrative of the microwave as a clever little convenience box, a machine that heats but does not cook. This is, of course, a dubious distinction: heating *is* cooking; the microwave *does* cook things. And yet, like so many people, I have been a reflexive fire supremacist, clinging to some culturally ingrained notion that electric cookery is less *real* than anything done with wood, charcoal, or natural gas lit aflame. (The microwave isn’t the only object of our collective disdain for electric appliances, though our sneering is inconsistent: a convection oven counts as a real piece of cooking equipment, for instance, while an air fryer is a mere device.)

I don't use a microwave often, but they can be incredibly useful and the snobbishness about them from some people never made any sense.
