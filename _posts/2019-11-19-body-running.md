Lauren Fleshman, writing in the *New York Times*:

> Over the past week, the athletic world has been embroiled in a reckoning following high school phenom Mary Cain’s story of suffering from an eating disorder and suicidal thoughts in pursuit of athletic success. Stories like hers are not new. What’s new, and what I think has triggered such outrage, is that she has audaciously put the blame where it belongs: on a sports system built by and for men.

It's true that [male runners can suffer](https://www.podiumrunner.com/body-expectations-of-male-runners_175645) from body expectations as well, but the problem appears to be far worse for women and it's disheartening to see stories like Mary Cain's.
