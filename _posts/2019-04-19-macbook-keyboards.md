Casey Johnston, writing for *the Outline*:

> Recently, in a discussion about Apple’s terrible butterfly keyboard design with a source who wished not to be identified and who definitely does not work for Apple, they noted I had bought a 2017 MacBook Pro and gotten rid of it after a little more than a year due to the now-notorious problems they have with something as simple as “a piece of dust” causing stuck or dead keys. “So, just curious, why did you buy another one?” she asked, referring to the 2018 MacBook Air I’d gotten six months after selling the Pro.

> I didn’t have an answer ready, but was impressed that she asked, because I felt largely like an idiot who deserved it. After selling back my MacBook Pro to Apple for about two-thirds of what I paid, my 2013 MacBook Pro (which I kept around even after buying the new Pro; yes, I have a lot of computers) that I returned to using started to show signs of age. It stopped recognizing its battery, even as the keyboard still worked flawlessly. I cast around to every other possible laptop solution — Chromebooks, Windows laptops, a Surface — before deciding I was too married to the Apple ecosystem to leave it.

Anyone that is still buying a notebook from Apple in 2019 does, in fact, largely deserve what they get. As Johnston has reported for what feels like years now, and as [others have shown](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-macbook-keyboard-fiasco-is-surely-worse-than-apple-thinks/), Apple has no interest in producing notebooks with functioning keyboards. And probably won't show any interest until people stop buying them and/or stop putting up with expensive and time consuming repairs that only temporarily address the issue.

Other than iMessage, there's nothing special about the *Apple ecosystem* on a Mac these days. There are far more interesting notebooks from other brands now and Windows 10 is a *fine* operating system that has a company doing a lot more to actively improve it than Apple has shown with macOS in recent years. I don't mind my hands leaving my LG Gram's functioning keyboard to pickup my iPhone and reply to a text message.
