Angela Lashbrook, writing for OneZero:

> What Goodreads is good for is keeping your own list of books you want to read or have read this year. It’s a list-making app. And while that’s useful, it doesn’t live up to the company’s full promise of being a haven for readers. Readers and authors deserve a better online community. And while Amazon has at least some nominal interest in improving many of its other products — Alexa, for example, becomes more advanced with each passing year — Goodreads lingers in the dustbin of the early aughts, doomed to the hideous beige design and uninspiring organization of a strip mall doctor’s office.

[I use Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2753148-david) to keep a log of the books I've read, but that's all it's ever been useful for to me. The recommendations have never been any good and don't seem to change no matter how many books I add and rate. Amazon's Kindle Store seems to do a much better job at showing me books I might be interested in and they could presumably use the same data and algorithm, so I don't get it.

I think I'll start [just keeping a log on my own website](/books/).
