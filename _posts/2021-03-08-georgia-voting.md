Nick Corasaniti and Jim Rutenberg, the *New York Times*:

> Now, Georgia Republicans are proposing new restrictions on weekend voting that could severely curtail one of the Black churchâ€™s central roles in civic engagement and elections. Stung by losses in the presidential race and two Senate contests, the state party is moving quickly to push through these limits and a raft of other measures aimed directly at suppressing the Black turnout that helped Democrats prevail in the critical battleground state.

> "The only reason you have these bills is because they lost," said Bishop Reginald T. Jackson, who oversees all 534 A.M.E. churches in Georgia. "What makes it even more troubling than that is there is no other way you can describe this other than racism, and we just need to call it what it is."

If you think people are overreacting when they call these proposed measures racist, the restrictions also include banning "the practice of having volunteers provide water, snacks, chairs and other assistance to voters in line." They're not trying to hide why they want these restrictions at all nor is there any attempt to broaden the voting appeal of the Republican party.
