David Roth writing for the *Columbia Journalism Review* about the horribleness of the modern web.

I recently had the pleasure of briefly browsing the web without a [blocker like uBlock Orgin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) or features like [Firefox's enhanced tracking protection](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop) enabled. It's not an experience I would wish on anyone.
