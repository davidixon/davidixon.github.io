★★★☆☆

I mostly read Deborah Reed's *Things We Set on Fire* because I needed to keep the reading streak on Amazon's Kindle Reading Insights feature active while I read some large hardcover books. This was apparently a book I 'purchased' for free from the Kindle Store back in 2013, but can't remember having read. There's quite a few of these books on my Kindle and I think I'll try to work on cutting into the unread backlog before buying more books.

Anyway, this was a quick enjoyable enough read about a family driven apart---and then together---by secrets, but the characters are pretty flat and there's very little in the plot you won't see coming miles ahead.
