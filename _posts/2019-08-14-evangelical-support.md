Elizabeth Bruenig, writing in the *Washington Post*:

> White evangelicals’ electoral drift toward Trump added an element of mystery to a story that was already startling. That the thrice-wed, dirty-talking, sex-scandal-plagued businessman actually managed to win the steadfast *moral* support of America’s values voters, as expressed in routinely high approval ratings, posed an even stranger question: What happened?

It's easy to say that abortion and simply getting justices on the Supreme Court that might overturn *Roe v. Wade* is enough for evangelicals to support Trump despite everything else, but Bruenig does a great job examining other reasons.
