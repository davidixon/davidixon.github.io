Miles ran this month: 194.4

Miles ran year to date: 194.4

Mileage goal for the year: 2500.0

I had hoped to run at least two hundred miles this month and was on pace to do so, but it rained for the entirety of the thirty-first day of this month and so I decided to take another rest day instead. I did [just read a book about the importance of recovery](/2020/01/31/book-reviews), after all.

I'm trying to make total mileage less important to me than it's been in past years and instead focus more on getting *faster*, but I know running more miles *slower* does help with that, so I'm still going to try to run *a little bit* more than the 2222.5 miles I ran in 2019 or the 2436.8 miles in 2018. This is a smaller jump than the ones I made between the years 2015 and 2017 when I first started running.

Of the twenty four times I ran this month, I'd classify two of them as speed workouts, five as fast/tempo runs, and the rest as easy runs. One of those east runs [was over sixteen miles](https://www.strava.com/activities/3042576590).
