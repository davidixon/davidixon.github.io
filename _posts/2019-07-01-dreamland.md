★★★☆☆

Sam Quinones' book [Dreamland: The True Tale of America's Opiate Epidemic](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U19DTS0/), published in 2015, is a fascinating look at how both prescription opiates and illicit heroin spread across the United States in recent decades. I was familiar with how Purdue Pharma aggressively---and deceptively---marketed Oxycontin as a safe non-addictive painkiller, for which [they continue being sued by victims and governments to this day](https://www.wsj.com/articles/purdue-pharma-grapples-with-internal-challenges-as-opioid-lawsuits-mount-11561887120). More interesting is how people from a small town in Mexico produced black tar heroin and began selling it in cities across the US, later taking advantage of all these people now addicted to OxyContin and looking for something cheaper to replace it with.

While Quinones makes a compelling case for how people of various social classes became victims of the opioid epidemic, I think his conclusion that if kids just spent more time playing outside and socializing with people outside their screens and weren't so coddled by their parents or society (he attacks so-called 'safe spaces' and 'trigger warnings' in schools, for example), they wouldn't resort to painkillers and drugs is rather weak.
