I ran 250 miles in November, which was the most miles I have ever managed to run in a month, eighteen miles more than in October. Currently, for the year, I'm about thirty-seven miles under my previous total mileage record of 2,436.8 miles set in 2018 and so I should easily eclipse that.

More importantly, [on Thanksgiving morning](https://www.strava.com/activities/4393343637), I set new personal bests for the mile (6:01), 5km (19:22) and 10km (41:07). Over the past few months, I did a fair amount of speed work to get that 5km time below 20:00 and I'm happy to see that it paid off, though it would've been nice if there weren't a global health pandemic and I did it in a race instead of a time trial on my own.

I probably won't run quite as many total miles in December as the weather starting off this month is a little too cold for my liking and so I think I might [follow a training plan](https://www.mcmillanrunning.com/the-best-10k-workout/) and focus on getting that 10km time a bit lower. Maybe we'll be able to race again sometime in the new year.
