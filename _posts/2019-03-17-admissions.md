Elizabeth Bruenig, writing for the *Washington Post*:

> News of the scandal has provoked near-unanimous anger, because what these ultra-rich moms and dads did wasn’t fair. But nothing about the American experience of social mobility is fair, and repairing that will require a much more radical reconsideration of society than smashing a pay-to-go racket.

If anything, one can hope that this scandal does away with the ludicrous idea [that minorities have an easier time getting into college](https://www.salon.com/2019/03/16/what-the-college-admissions-scam-reveals-about-race-privilege-and-higher-ed/) than more advantaged white people.
