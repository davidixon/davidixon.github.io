Nicholas Casey, writing for the *New York Times*:

> Ms. Miller, who spends her work day helping register people to vote, scrolled through the names and then asked herself a question: What was her own voter status in the state?

> She went online and discovered that her name had also been flagged as an inactive voter. The state was in the process of removing her from its voter rolls.

It seems bizarre that in much of the United States, one needs to manually register to vote and then pro-actively search their state's database to make sure they haven't been purged from the rolls. The only reason someone should be removed from the rolls is if the state *knows* they've died or moved and registered in another state. Surely, the technology exists to do this if you're interested in making sure only eligible people are allowed to vote and not just looking to purge the voter rolls of people who may vote to put you out of office.
