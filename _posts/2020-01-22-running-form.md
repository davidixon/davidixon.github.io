Alex Hutchinson, *Outside*:

> The physiologist and coach Jack Daniels once filmed a bunch of runners in stride, then showed the footage to coaches and biomechanists to see if they could eyeball who was the most efficient. “They couldn’t tell,” Daniels later recalled. “No way at all.” Famously awkward-looking runners like Paula Radcliffe and Alberto Salazar sometimes turn out to be extraordinarily efficient. Smooth-striding beauties sometimes finish at the back of the pack.

> The act of running, it turns out, is surprisingly complicated. The bob of your head, the rotation of your hips, the angle of your foot—all these factors and many others can vary in endless ways. So it’s a more or less hopeless task to simply watch someone run past and diagnose problems with their stride, whether it’s inefficiencies or vulnerabilities to certain types of injury. Amid the endless variables, we can’t possibly zero in on the ones that matter in real time.

Running the way that feels most comfortable to you and resting when you feel tired turns out to be more important for injury prevention than trying to change your foot strike or form to what others deem to be "correct".
