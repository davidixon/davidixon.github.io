> When you’re looking at a search result with hundreds of options on Amazon, the “Amazon’s Choice” label may give you a sense of relief. The label’s name and prominent placement seem to imply that listings with the “Amazon’s Choice” designation — even more authoritative than a simple “Best-Selling” badge — are a curated selection of products reviewed and tested by the company, and highlighted for shoppers looking for similar products. But “Amazon’s Choice” isn’t that at all, and here’s the disappointing news: It’s a label automatically awarded to listings by an algorithm based on customer reviews, price, and whether the product is in stock. And those choices Amazon’s software makes aren’t always reliable — in fact, sometimes they’re Amazon-recommended crap.

"Amazon's Choice" has apparently been around since 2015, but I've only noticed it while shopping on the website in the last few months and the things with the label almost always look like junk. Increasingly, if you want to buy something from Amazon, you need to know the exact product you want before ever going to their website, make extra-sure the product you do find on Amazon matches up with what you want and probably make sure that you're buying something sold and shipped by Amazon.com and not a third-party who might be selling knock-offs. Sometimes, [even that isn't enough](https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2016/10/apple-sues-mobile-star-for-selling-counterfeit-power-adapters-and-charging-cables-through-amazon.html).
