Chris DeVille, interviewing Julien Baker and writing for *Sterogum*:

> *Little Oblivions* is the bleakest, brightest Julien Baker album yet. It’s not quite accurate to say that Baker’s third LP, out today, pulls the time-honored trick of matching sad lyrics with upbeat, poppy music. She continues to set her thoughtful confessionals to chords and melodies that emphasize the heart-wrenching beauty of her words, bringing the high drama of emo and post-rock to bear on singer-songwriter indie rock. But even as the Nashville-based artist ventures into some of her darkest lyrical territory yet, her arrangements explode with unprecedented life and color.

The album's been out for about five days and I have probably listened to it a dozen times already. So great.
