Stephen King's latest novel, *The Institute*, is about a government agency which kidnaps children and places them in a detention center where they're exploited. It's not hard to draw parallels with what the United States government [is currently doing to children seeking refuge in this country](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/only-now-do-we-understand-the-true-cruelty-of-trumps-family-separation/2019/10/29/8294ef9e-f9cf-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html), though we're at least not yet executing the parents like this fictitious government does.

These kids are kidnapped because they have telekinetic and telepathic powers that the Institute wants to exploit in order to kill bad people and prevent them from destroying the world. The Institute's doctors give children shots and outright tortures them in attempts to increase their powers and this eventually backfires on them when a twelve year-old, Luke Ellis, and his group of friends devise a plan to escape and bring the agency down.
