01 [Can We Finally Agree to Ignore Election Forecasts?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/opinion/election-forecasts-modeling-flaws.html) Zeynep Tufekci published this two days before Election Day and it has held up quite well, days later as we're only just now beginning to see a clear winner in what was a much closer race than any of the polls suggested.

02 [America Chose Sickness, and Lost the Economy](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/the-economy-cant-recover-with-sick-workers/616947/). Annie Lowrey on the false choice between combating the virus and reopening the economy as the United States as the [number of cases and number of deaths spikes yet again](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/us/coronavirus-today-what-happened.html) with no economic relief from the federal government since the CARES Act was passed in March.

03 [The Final Gasp of Donald Trumpâ€™s Presidency](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/11/donald-trump-presidency-election-week.html). Few people have covered the presidential campaigns and the presidency of Donald Trump better than Olivia Nuzzi and she'll probably have to write a few more stories on the end before Trump accepts the inevitable and leaves the White House.

A book I finished reading this week:

[*Troubled Blood*](https://www.amazon.com/Troubled-Blood-Cormoran-Strike-Novel-ebook/dp/B084X5WVX9), the fifth novel in the Cormoran Strike series written by Robert Galbraith, better known as J.K. Rowling. Like the *Harry Potter* series, each new novel in the series gets longer, with this one weighing in at over nine hundred pages. Some of those pages drag on, but it's still a very enjoyable detective story.
