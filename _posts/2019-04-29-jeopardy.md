Casey Johnston, writing for *The Outline*:

> Holzhauer knows some niche stuff and is incredibly solid on classic subjects like geography, but he is not encyclopedic. This is reflected in his play: He hardly ever buzzes in on a clue he doesn’t know (he has a 97-percent correct answer rate, and a higher Coryat score than Jennings), but he regularly loses out easy-ish clues to other players, sometimes seemingly on the buzzer and sometimes because he just doesn’t know. He is mellow and unflappable and it never feels like he is specifically railroading his opponents, yet when you look down at the end of a round he has 30 times as much money as the other two players.

Starting with the most valuable questions first is such an obvious and brilliant strategy that I'm not sure why we haven't seen it used so successfully until now.
