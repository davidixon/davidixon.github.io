Campbell Robertson, writing for *The New York Times*:

> Some say the whole mess was so exhausting and embarrassing that by the time the legislature adjourned on Feb. 24, the outrage had burned itself out. Others point to polls that showed Virginia voters were considerably less hungry for resignations than their representatives were. Some political observers mused about more fundamental changes to the life span of scandal, describing President Trump’s approach to bad press as if it were a revolutionary medical breakthrough.

> “Don’t apologize, move on, and everybody will talk about something else next week,” is how Ben Tribbett, a Democratic strategist, described it. “Maybe we’ve been doing it wrong over the last 100 years.”

Like many others, the numerous and continuing scandals involving the current occupant of the White House, and [those of other states](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/us/robin-hayes-nc-indictment.html) since this story has caused me to completely forget about it. I don't think Northam or Fairfox would've survived these stories had they broke just a few short years ago.
