★★★★☆

[*The Girls*](https://bookshop.org/books/the-girls-9780812988024/9780812998603) is a novel published in 2016 that I have re-read a few times over the years. The story is obviously based on Charles Manson's cult and their murder of Sharon Tate and others in 1969, but with the names and other details changed. As someone who was previously interested in such things and who listened to [the excellent series about the murders from the *You Must Remember This* podcast](https://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/episodes/2020/1/20/charles-mansons-hollywood) in 2015, the novel appealed to me a lot when first released and I found it to be very good. The key fictional change Cline makes to the history is the main protagonist, Evie Boyd, an isolated fourteen year old girl, who becomes enamored of the girls she sees around town stealing from stores, dumpster diving and who seemingly have a care-free life, and who joins the cult of the Manson-like man to remain close to them. I've become less interested in reading about the lives of serial killers and cult leaders over the years, but Cline's writing still makes this a quick enjoyable read.
