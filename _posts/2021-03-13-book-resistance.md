★★★☆☆

[*Resistance: A Songwriter's Story of Hope, Change, and Courage*](https://bookshop.org/books/resistance-a-songwriter-s-story-of-hope-change-and-courage/9781982104153) is partly a memoir and partly a "call to action" about the political climate in the United States and world. The use of the word "resistance" in the title of a book published in 2020 will tell most people what Tori Amos' political leanings are, and while I generally agree with most of the positions she espouses, it's the memoir part of the book that was far more interesting for someone who loves her music and wants to know what inspired the creation of it.

Each chapter shares its title with one of her songs and she writes about the inspiration for the song, or the album it's contained on, and what was going on in her life at the time. Sometimes she writes about what a song has come to mean to her, or to fans that have written or talked to her, in more contemporary times. The tying of a song to some current political issue can feel like a bit of a stretch and these chapters tend to be on the shorter side. Partial lyrics to the songs are also included throughout the book, and while I liked reading them, they mostly seemed to be there to inflate the page count.
