As a 30 year old millennial, I can count the numbers of times I've been to a traditional mall in the last ten years on one hand. But two of those times were one day a few weeks ago, to use an expiring gift certificate away from home, and while [one was as dead and depressing](https://www.shopbassettplace.com/) as I expected, [the other mall](https://www.simon.com/mall/cielo-vista-mall) was surprisingly filled with young people on a weekday after school.

Obviously, not every store *within* that mall was doing well. The Macy's I walked through to enter was pretty empty and I doubt the Sears at the other end was doing any better, but otherwise, the place was busy.

Of course, I ended up actually purchasing something at the Finish Line store in the dead mall, because they had shoes I wanted in stock and the employees quickly assisted me in getting the size I wanted and checked out since there was all of one other customer in the store.
