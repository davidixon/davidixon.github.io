I like [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) well enough as an idea, but wasn't quite happy with the limitations of it as a blogging platform. It just doesn't give me the kind of control I wanted on something that is supposed to be *my* website.

So, I'm giving [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) another try and hosting on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for now. I might look into other systems, but I'm familiar with Jekyll from using it with previous websites and an pretty happy with it after a bit of tinkering. Git integration in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) makes it a relatively seamless process to write something and have it published.

I may or may not import my previous posts from Micro.blog, but I do like the idea of starting fresh.
