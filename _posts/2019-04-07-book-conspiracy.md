★★★★☆

When it was revealed that Peter Thiel was funding [the lawsuit that led to Gawker's shutdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollea_v._Gawker) in 2016, I thought it was another example of an entitled billionaire trying to silence criticism and an attack on the freedom of the press. One can understand why someone might be upset about being publicly outed as gay, especially in 2007, but plotting for years and spending millions of dollars to fund a lawsuit unrelated to yourself in an effort to shutter a media outlet seemed a rather extreme reaction.

But learning more about that lawsuit and how *Gawker* came into possession of the Hulk Hogan tapes and their inability to apologize for what were obvious privacy violations of Hogan&mdash;and others&mdash;doesn't make them very sympathetic. They deserved to be lose this lawsuit and their arrogance and unwillingness to settle is what led to the $140 million in damages being awarded. And while Gawker might be gone, Univision did acquire many of their blogs like *Deadspin*, who continue to do excellent reporting on occasion, so it wasn't a total loss.

Ryan Holiday is a gifted writer, but while I can understand some references to the works of Niccolò Machiavelli and historical events like the American Civil War and World War II, they're much too frequent and the book could probably been cut down fifty pages without losing anything of value.
