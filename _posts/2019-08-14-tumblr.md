*The Verge's* Nilay Patel and Julia Alexander interviewed Matt Mullenweg about Automattic's recent acquisition of Tumblr.

Tumblr was once such a great blogging *and* social networking platform and I enjoyed using it before it's years of stagnation under ownership by Yahoo and then Verizon. I hope they're successful in reviving it. Maybe I'll switch this blog back to Tumblr again.
