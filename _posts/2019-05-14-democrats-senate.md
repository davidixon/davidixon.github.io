Jamelle Bouie, writing for *The New York Times*:

> And if they can’t win a majority, Mitch McConnell may cripple a Democratic presidency from the start, blocking judicial and executive branch nominations in an even more extreme replay of his blockade of President Barack Obama’s final Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. Without the Senate in hand, Democrats could win the immediate fight against Donald Trump in 2020 but lose the larger battle against the Republican Party that supported and enabled him.

I can understand the appeal of running for president for people like Beto O'Rourke, John Hickenlooper, and [now Steve Bullock](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/politics/steve-bullock-2020.html). You get a lot of media attention, raise your profile, and might even manage to win your party's nomination and even the presidency itself. But I sure wish some of these people cared about their country a bit more and ran for seats in the Senate, where their chances of success are much higher and they could do far more good.
