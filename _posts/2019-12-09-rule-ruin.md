★★★☆☆

The full title of this book is [*Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party, From Eisenhower to the Tea Party*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UFCPHG/), but it really covers very little past the 1960s and the Nixon administration. Reagan, the Bushes and the Tea Party movement are only given a few short chapters towards the end.

The Republican party underwent a lot of changes during the 1960s, of course, and Geoffrey Kabaservice does a great job detailing many of them from the contentious 1964 presidential primary, the embrace of the Southern Strategy and white resentment of a changing country, and the pushing out of moderates that conservatives considered no longer Republican enough. This holds up just as well when I first read the book when it was new in 2012. I just feel that there wasn't much attention given afterwards, almost as if the author realized he was supposed to be covering the party's history through to the end but spent so much time in the 1960s that he had to rush through the rest. And, of course, the Republican party has become even more unrecognizable between 2012 and 2019.
