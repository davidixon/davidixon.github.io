Masha Gessen, writing for *The New Yorker*:

> Like many arguments, the fight over the term “concentration camp” is mostly an argument about something entirely different. It is not about terminology. Almost refreshingly, it is not an argument about facts. This argument is about imagination, and it may be a deeper, more important conversation than it seems.

Whatever you want to call them, the [camps holding migrant children](https://apnews.com/46da2dbe04f54adbb875cfbc06bbc615) are horrific and all Americans should be ashamed their government is doing this in their name.
