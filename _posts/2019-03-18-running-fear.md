Katie Arnold, writing for *Outside*:

> There’s one question that people always ask me about running alone in the backcountry. It’s the same question they ask me about taking young children down whitewater rivers. I know because it’s also the one I ask myself. Aren’t you scared?

As a man, I've only had to deal with the occasional person screaming a dumb comment from their truck while running. Women have so many horror stories, including this one of being physically assaulted, that I'm amazed so many continue running.
