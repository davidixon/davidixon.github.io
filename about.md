Comma Splice is the personal website of David Dixon.

The website is currently produced with [Jekyll][1] and hosted on [GitHub Pages][2]. The design is based on [Lanyon][3]. This is subject to change, but is accurate as of early 2019.

If you'd like, you can follow me on [Twitter][4], [Instagram][5] and [Strava][6].

You can also send email to david at this domain.
